# Watcher for watching Zookeeper for entries containing DNS names that are
# continuously resolved to IP Addresses.  The use case for this watcher is to
# allow services that are addressed by DNS to be reconfigured via Zookeeper
# instead of an update of the synapse config.
#
# The implementation builds on top of the existing DNS and Zookeeper watchers.
# This watcher creates a thread to manage the lifecycle of the DNS and
# Zookeeper watchers.  This thread also publishes messages on a queue to
# indicate that DNS should be re-resolved (after the check interval) or that
# the DNS watcher should be shut down.  The Zookeeper watcher waits for changes
# in backends from zookeeper and publishes those changes on an internal queue
# consumed by the DNS watcher.  The DNS watcher blocks on this queue waiting
# for messages indicating that new servers are available, the check interval
# has passed (triggering a re-resolve), or that the watcher should shut down.
# The DNS watcher is responsible for the actual reconfiguring of backends.

    #   changes.  The default servers can also come into play if none of the
    #   hostnames from Zookeeper resolve to addresses in the DNS watcher.  This
    #   should generally result in the expected behavior, but caution should be
